# Business Site

This week's assignment was to build a business site. It had to have a Hero header, an image or a video, 
one accordion with the commonly asked question, and a sign-up form for the business.  

I started with designing in figama, first with a fig draft to make a plane for my project, then I design how I wanted it to look on mobile, 
tablet, and desktop. 

I had a great plan so it was easy to know what I wanted. I started with adding everything to 
html and little by little to the css to be able to see what I needed to do. I had problems with 
the accordion and how to make it work, with help from my team we managed to solve it together!

I started from mobile first and everything went well, but on the desktop, I had problems with positioning 
the boxes where I wanted them. With the help of grid and a team friend we made it work! 

If I had the time I would love to add the things a business site need
like a nave bar, social info, and more content but I'm happy with the result!
